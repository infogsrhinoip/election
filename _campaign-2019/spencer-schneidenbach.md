## Why I'm Running
My name is Spencer Schneidenbach and my interest in the .NET Foundation Board of Directors is centered around **advocacy and outreach**. As a community leader, my goal is to represent the interests of community leaders around the globe, including but not limited to: user group leaders, conference organizers, other Microsoft MVPs, bloggers, and conferences speakers.

I have proven experience in building relationships with the greater .NET and surrounding communities and want to **leverage those relationships to advance the cause of the .NET ecosystem**. Further, I want to expand that by representing .NET in communities where it may not normally be first-choice and/or still has a bad rap from the "old" Microsoft days üôÇ

I also have an interest in representing corporate and/or so-called "dark matter" developers. Because I frequently attend and speak at conferences around the world, I get the pleasure of interacting with folks who normally do not get a voice at the table. I've traded tweets and emails with many of these folks, with the goal of making .NET more accessible for developers worldwide.

**In short, I want to provide a strong voice to the users and advocates of .NET.** The best way I can think to do that is to keep doing what I'm doing - teaching and speaking about .NET - while combining that with a seat on the .NET Foundation board of directors.

I'm also a big believer in brevity, which is why I tried to keep my campaign statement short. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
