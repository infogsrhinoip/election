### How to Build this Site

* You'll need Ruby (I believe the recommended version is `v2.4.x`)
* Install bundler by running `gem install bundler`
* Open the directory of the repository on your local machine
* Run `bundle install` to install the site's dependencies
* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve the web site, which will start on `http://localhost:4000`
