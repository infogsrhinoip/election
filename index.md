title: .NET Foundation Board Member Elections
---

## Your .NET Foundation

We recently announced some big changes to the .NET Foundation, and one of the biggest is that we’re moving to a community elected Board of Directors. We're expanding the board from three to seven members, with one single seat appointed by Microsoft and the remaining six elected by the community. This structure will help the .NET Foundation scale and better serve the .NET ecosystem.

**If you’re passionate about open source .NET, we’d like you to think about running in the elections!**

## What’s Changed?

Since the .NET Foundation was created, we’ve had three board members, all appointed by Microsoft. We’re changing that to seven board members, only one appointed by Microsoft. The remaining six are voted in by the community in yearly elections.

## What does the .NET Foundation Board Do?

The board completely runs the .NET Foundation. They decide how the money is spent, what projects join the foundation, what the Executive Director (that’s me) does, what programs the foundation will run or be involved with, what events we’ll sponsor. The board runs the foundation.



## How Do Campaigns and Elections Work?

*   We’ll be running a simple campaign mini-site using GitHub pages and pull requests. Candidates will submit a campaign statement as a markdown file pull request and can link off to other information if they want (e.g. video, podcast interviews, projects, etc.).
*   We’d love to see community discussion wherever it happens – Twitter, forums, etc. – following the [standard code of conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).
*   In the last week of the election cycle, voting members will cast their votes. We’re using the [Single Transferable Vote methodology on the OpaVote system](https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote).
*   The board serves for one year, after which you can choose to run for reelection.
