# .NET Foundation Campaign: Sean Killeen

## Why I'm Running

* **To listen**: I think one of the things we must do as a foundation is meet a variety of stakeholders where they are and help make it easy for them to get to the next step on their journey. That's what a lot of my [2017 "Casting a Wider .NET" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFDXNGFvcYg) was about. Since then I've attempted to do so in small ways, but I think we have an opportunity to map out paths to success for all of our various stakeholders and show real transparent progress.
* **To make an impact:** I think .NET Foundation has the chance to impact so many developers' lives in terms of bringing them the best possible community engagement & support. My entire career to date has been focused on ways to add the maximum possible impact in various situations, and those who've come across me would I think attest to my ability to achieve that impact.
* **To spread the love and stop the burnout**: A lot of folks have been carrying the torch for .NET OSS in a lot of ways. From what I can tell, many of them are (understandably) a bit tired & worn down, on the verge or or past the point of burnout. How can we find them, reach them, support them in supporting our community -- without making them feel they have to compromise in some way?
* **To address the cultural divide of OSS & Development practices in .NET:** My consulting background has exposed me to a lot of different development cultures in what I'll call the "legacy mentality", and I see first-hand how much work we have as a community to move forward into modernity. I believe we can move the .NET ecosystem from a largely consumption-only mindset to an ecosystem that encourages & supports active contributions from a variety of sources. I'd be excited to tackle this challenge with broader support as a member of the board.
* **To figure out a way to avoid "NIH" syndrome**: Not-invented-here syndrome has plagued the ecosystem for a long time and can be highly demoralizing to maintainers or producers of work who feel like they may then have to compete with a large corporate player whose products/libraries immediately become a de facto standard. I think with some process & communication changes, we can involve community members earlier in the process and move to a place where the community is the first stop for some of these discussions, and where we can be fully informed if a different direction is chosen that the community may not expect. If .NET has largely made the transition to an OSS-first mindset, surely we can more fully make the transition to a community-first mindset.
* **To better surface ways to help**: The Foundation has a big job, and I think there are lot of folks beyond the board & foundation members who are ready and willing to pitch in. What can we do to make the needs & roadmap known, to inspire others to contribute their ideas and time to move things forward? 

But honestly, the biggest reason? 

* **Because I grew up here, and it feels like home.**. My Dad is a .NET developer since the earliest days and so learning from him got me started early on. I have developed a great affection for this community and the people in it and have learned so much from folks -- the blog posts / Pluralsight / Channel 9 authors, the friendly OSS maintainers, the Twitter community. I have seen the contributions from all corners and I stand on the shoulders of those giants. While I've begun contributing back to the community for some time in various ways, this seems like an opportunity to take the .NET community to the next level and I'd be honored to be part of that.

## Why Me Specifically?
* **Firstly, because it's important:** I want to echo Jon Skeet's point in his candidacy -- I really don't want this board to be made up entirely of white guys (and yet cannot escape that I am one myself). I've reached out to several folks to ask them to consider throwing their names in here, and I hope they will so that I can support their candidacy as well. If elected, I think a primary consideration needs to be making .NET accessible to and represented by folks from the entirety of our developer community. If your choice comes down to me vs. anyone who is less represented in tech, I'd whole-heartedly support your selecting someone less generally well-represented than me.
* **I'm a teacher at heart:** At my current employer, in additional to technical leadership across clients, I train software developers and testers from all over on agile principles and practices (the mindset, not the prescriptive guidance) and how to apply better approaches to their software development. I have a sense of how to reach people, and also some of the broader themes that folks may struggle with as they attempt to level up their software development & OSS knowledge.
* **I'm _not_ a famous community member**: I say this half-jokingly, but I do think it's important to an extent. I think I have a perspective and community that often reflects the day-to-day challenges of moving things forward, and therefore I may be able to find ways to move folks forward from where they are. 

## My .NET Contributions
I am by no means as well-known as many of the members here. But that hasn't stopped me from contributing in my own ways.

* I maintain a tiny link-shortener project called [xluhco](http://github.com/excellalabs/xluhco)
* During [a kerfuffle around including the Paket package manager in the nuget gallery](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/pull/4437), I [created a Chrome extension](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/paket-attacket) to allow the expected result in the interim while things were discussed.
* I've contributed to [Akka.NET](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged) and [its web site](https://github.com/akkadotnet/getakka.net/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [The .NET Core Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/aspnetcore-app-workshop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [Octokit.NET](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [ASP.NET docs](https://github.com/aspnet/docs/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [Up-for-grabs.net](https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [the RavenDB book](https://github.com/ravendb/book/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged), [fixed VB syntax highlighting on the office docs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content/pull/3), [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/pull/451), [Discover.NET](https://github.com/daveaglick/discoverdotnet/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3ASeanKilleen+is%3Aclosed+is%3Amerged)    (I know this because of a tool I'm working on OSSing called PortfoliOSS)
* I have a number of [blog posts](https://SeanKilleen.com), [talks](http://SeanKilleen.com/Presentations), and [AMAs](https://github.com/SeanKilleen/ama) where I attempt to give back knowledge that I have or share what I learn.
